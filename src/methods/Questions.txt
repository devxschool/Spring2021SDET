- What are data types?
- What is a variable in java?
    -> Name of the location where we store some values,
    it contains data and the names should be unique and meaningful;
    -> we can overwrite variables [EX: int temp = 0
    but we can update it's value as needed,
    temp = 1 and now value temp variable holds is equal to 1]

- How do we cast double to int? EX: double x = 2.5132165 convert it to
    int y = (int) x; y -> 2;

- What is a method in java?
    -> Methods in java is the block of code that runs when it's called;
    -> they are used to avoid repetition, create once and use them as many times as needed;

- What is a return type in a method? Why do we need it?
    -> int sum(int num1, int num2){
           return int;
    }

- What are the access modifiers in java?
    -> they are used to set the visibility(accessibility) of methods:
        - public -> accessible in all classes
        - private -> accessible only within the same class
        - default -> accessible within the same class and or package
        - protected -> accessible in the class defined and it's subclasses

- How do we create a method(Method structure)?
What are the best practices to follow?
    EX: // create a method that can take 2 integers and return their
    // sum as an integer and it has to be public and static

    public static int addTwoNumbers(int num1, int num2){

        int sum = num1 + num2;
        return sum;

    }
