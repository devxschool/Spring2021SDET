	1. Implicit vs explicit type casting?

	Implicit -> assigning one data type to another, form smaller to bigger data type;
	Explicit -> manual conversion, from large data type to smaller.
	EX: Explicit:
	    double a = 12.3;
	    int b = (int) a;

	2. Write a method that takes an array of integers as a parameter and returns an array of strings with the same size
	as the integer array, which will correspond to each integer in the array with either "even" or "odd".
	EX: given array {1,2,3,4} -> expected return array of strings is {"odd", "even", "odd", "even"}.
	Pay attention that each of these strings are corresponding to each of the given integers in the array.

	3. How to convert a char array to char arraylist?

	4. Method to reverse a string?  EX: Given string="Change your life with Devxschool!" -> expected: "!loohcsxveD htiw efil ruoy egnahC".
	5. Types of Set collection? And their differences?

    6. Difference between String and String Builder?
       What methods does String Builder has that String class doesn't have? Examples need to be provided with answers.
