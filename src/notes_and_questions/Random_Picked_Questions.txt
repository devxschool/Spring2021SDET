	1. Implicit vs explicit type casting?

	Implicit -> assigning one data type to another, form smaller to bigger data type;
	Explicit -> manual conversion, from large data type to smaller.
	EX: Explicit:
	    double a = 12.3;
	    int b = (int) a;

	2. Write a method that takes an array of integers as a parameter and returns an array of strings with the same size
	as the integer array, which will correspond to each integer in the array with either "even" or "odd".
	EX: given array {1,2,3,4} -> expected return array of strings is {"odd", "even", "odd", "even"}.
	Pay attention that each of these strings are corresponding to each of the given integers in the array.

	3. How to convert a char array to char arraylist?

	4. Method to reverse a string?  EX: Given string="Change your life with Devxschool!" -> expected: "!loohcsxveD htiw efil ruoy egnahC".
	5. Types of Set collection? And their differences?

    6. Difference between String and String Builder?
       What methods does String Builder has that String class doesn't have? Examples need to be provided with answers.

       1. What are variables?
       Variables store information and they have data types.
       2. What are instance variables?
       Instance variables are created outside of the methods but inside the class in class level, so that
       when we initialize an object those instance variables van get initialized.
       3. What is a class in java?
       Entity that determines how will the object of it's type behave and what will it contain [it's states]
       States of an object are defined by classes instance variables.
       4. What are objects in java?
       - Objects are data or behavior that describe the class and also they instances of the class.

       - Given String str = “Trust the process and connect the dots” and write a method that takes this
       string as an input and return an Array of strings with each of the word as a separate element in it;

       - Write a method to find the min, max and average of numbers from the given array.
       EX: [1,2,3,4,5] -> int min = 1, int max = 5 and double average = 3.00;

       - Write a method that takes an array of strings as a parameter and returns a Map<Integer, String> indices
       of the array as keys and string elements at those indexes as values for them;

       - Write a Switch() statement for the months of the year and days of the week;
