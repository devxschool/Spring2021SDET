- Switch case statement syntax?
	EX: I want to print out weekday [Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu] or weekend[Sat, Sun]
	depending on the day of the week by using switch()
		String day = “Friday”;
		switch (day){
                    case "Monday":
                    case "Tuesday":
                    case "Wednesday":
                    case "Thursday":
                    case "Friday":
                        System.out.println("Weekday");
                        break;
                    case "Saturday", "Sunday":
                        System.out.println("Weekend");
                        break;
                    default:
                        System.out.println("It's not a day");
                }
