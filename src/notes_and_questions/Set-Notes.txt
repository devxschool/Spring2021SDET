1) What do you know about an ArrayList
2) What is the difference between an Array and ArrayList
ArrayList was implemented using array
Set - is a collection that contains no duplicate elements, and whose elements are not in a particular order. DOsen't allow primitive data types. Data in Set is not indexed;
The most common use for Set is to verify if any particular (given) element is a part of our collection(group)
Distinct - meaning no duplicates; Unique values;
HashSet - Stored unique elements in no particular order;
LinkedHashSet - stores elements in order they were received;
TreeSet stores elements in their natural order or provided order using Comparator;
currentCollection.addAll(providedCollection) adds all the elements form a provided collection to current collection;
add(element) adds the provided element to a Set;
size(); returns the length(size) of a Set;
remove(element) removes the provided element from a set;
set.clear() Clear method removes all elements from the set, the result will be an               empty set
isEmpty() returns true if your set is actually empty(no elements) and false                   otherwise
contains(element) returns true if current set contains the given element
Autoboxing - an automatic process that converts primitives to Objects
After U scan for an Integer you should close the line with empty .nextLine() statement in order to read String next;
Iterator - Is used to iterate through elements of a collection, especially unindexed collection;
Provide the same type for your iterator that is the type of the collection you iterate through
iterator() returns an iterator Object for that spec collection
Retrieve -  get the element from a collection to perform some actions
Difference between .remove(element) method of a set and .remove of an iterator
- 1st one expects an input element to be removed;
- 2nd no input, removes the element of a current iteration;
Iterator iterates through all the elements only 1 way and only once
